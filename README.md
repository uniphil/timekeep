website visitor logging that's nice to your visitors

stuff:

- don't track people on an individual level. respect people. maybe don't use this at all.
- visitor logging is the least important, most expendable data.
- don't add features. especially if they won't give clearly actionable information. also because redeploying wipes the counts lol.
- don't save anything for more than 30 days. let it go.
