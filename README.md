website visitor logging that's nice to your visitors

stuff:

- respect people
- don't break stuff
- don't track people on an individual level. maybe don't use this at all.
- visitor logging is the least important, most expendable data.
- don't add features. especially if they won't give clearly actionable information. also because redeploying wipes the counts lol.
- don't save anything for more than 30 days. let it go.

todo:

- maybe collect stats on user agents => eventually just try to estimate how many visits are bots
- consider not adding ips to the bloom if DNT=1
